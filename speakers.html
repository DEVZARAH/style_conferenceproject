                    <p>HEAVY METAL CODING</p>
                    <p>
                        In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks
                        in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning - both of code and drum
                        beats! You'll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner's heavy metal drum
                        patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to
                        code frustration than beating seven shades of ** out of a drum kit.
